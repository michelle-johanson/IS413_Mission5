    <h1>Grim Reaper Game Project</h1>
    <p>
        One of my favorite hobbies is making a small video game with my sister. It’s a 2D platformer where you
        play as a grim reaper whose job is to collect souls and protect them from demons.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really enjoy the early creative stage of game development: sketching ideas, figuring out how characters
        should move, and experimenting with how everything fits together on screen. A lot of this project is
        about testing ideas quickly and seeing what feels right.

        This image shows early concept sketches for the game. I was experimenting with different soul shapes,
        poses, and how they might sit or move on platforms. These sketches help me think through gameplay and
        visual consistency before committing to anything.

        I’ve also been practicing basic animation for the game. Animation is newer for me, but I really like how
        much personality you can add with small movements. Even simple animations make the characters feel more
        alive and responsive.

        Overall, this project is less about finishing a perfect game and more about learning, experimenting,
        and having fun building something together. It’s a hobby I keep coming back to because it mixes art,
        problem-solving, and creativity in a way I really enjoy.
